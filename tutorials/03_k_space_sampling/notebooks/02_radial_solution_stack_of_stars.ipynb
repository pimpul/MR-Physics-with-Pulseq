        "- Notes:\n",
        "  - Instead of the suggested increase of `slice_thickness`, we opted for the alternative of using `Nz*slice_thickness` as the FOV and slice selection thickness (typically you'd now call this \"slab-selective excitation\").\n",
        "  - Instead of the suggested double loop, we used a `phase_encode_table` (similar to exercise 1) to allow reordering of radial steps and Z-phase-encodes. This was necessary to deal with the dummy acquisitions at the start of scanning. You would not want to repeat the dummy acquisitions for every Z-encoding step.\n",
        "  - Similarly, instead of first planning `gz_pre` for the max phase encoding strength, we just recreate it in the sequence loop with the duration of `gx_pre`. This is fine as long as the duration of `gx_pre` is sufficiently long.\n",
